Connect Game:

Student Name: Jake Knudsen

Issues: Win Logic not implemented yet.

Notes: None.

----

Tester Name: Beau (First time playing game)

Silent Test Notes:
Visuals would be helpful, 
Confused on how game would look like, while reading instructions,
Toast warning was helpful.

Interview Notes:
Picture for reference in instructions would be helpful,
Win condition explanations were confusing,
UI was big enough for mobile, maybe too small for computer screen,
The "heads up" (toast) really helped understand the game.

Issues: Win Logic was not put in. When he won, I told him because it's not implemented.

Fix:
Add an "or" for the win conditions, tester thought you had to do both,
Explain the win conditions better,
Add a picture reference in the game instructions,

... Repeat for each Tester.
